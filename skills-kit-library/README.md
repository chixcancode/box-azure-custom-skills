The Box Skills Kit Library allows your application to receive and interpret event notifications from Box, retrieve data from Box, and write to metadata in Box. 

The Box Skills Kit Node.js Library contains two classes:
* The **Files Reader** class interprets incoming events from Box and can retrieve files from Box for processing
* The **Skills Writer** class writes data to a set of metadata templates in Box

Using these two classes, your application can retrieve files as they're uploaded to Box for processing and write the outputs of the processing to Box's metadata. This metadata information can be used to drive other Box functionality, such as search and preview.

## FilesReader
A helpful class to capture file information from the incoming event notification from Box and to retrieve the file's content from Box

**FilesReader( boxEvent.body ) CONSTRUCTOR**

| Functions                                           | Returns          | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| getFileContext ()                       | FileContext JSON | Returns a JSON containing fileId, fileName, fileFormat, fileType, fileSize, fileDownloadURL, fileReadToken, fileWriteToken, skillId, requestId for use in code. |
| validateFormat (allowedFileFormatsList) | Boolean          | Helper function to check if a given file is eligible to be processed by the skill as per the list of allowed formats.                                           |
| validateSize (allowedMegabytesNum)     | Boolean          | Helper function to check if a given file is eligible to be processed by the skill as per the size limit.                                                        |
| async getContentBase64()                    | String           | Returns a Blob of the file content in Base64 encoding. Note: ML providers generally have a size limit on passing raw file content as a string                   |
| getContentStream()                    | Stream           | Returns a Read Stream to be passed to read file directly from box. Note: Some ML providers support passing file read streams.                                   |
| async getBasicFormatFileURL()               | String           | Same as filesReader.getFileContext().fileDownloadURL but in BasicFormat (See Note below)                                                                        |
| async getBasicFormatContentBase64()         | String           | Same as filesReader.getFileContext().getContentBase64() but in BasicFormat (See Note below)                                                                     |
| async getBasicFormatContentStream()         | Stream           | Same as filesReader.getFileContext().getContentStream() but in BasicFormat(See Note below)                                                                      |

Note: BasicFormat functions allows you to access files stored in Box in another format, which may be more accepted by ML providers. The provided basic formats are Audio files→.mp3, Document/Image files→extracted_text, Video files→.mp4. Caution should be excercised using BasicFormats for certain large files as it involves a time delay, and your skill code or skills-engine request may time out before the converted format is fetched.
 
 ## SkillsWriter
 A helpful class to write metadata to Box to display in cards for Topics, Transcripts, Timelines, Errors and Statuses for any file for which a Box Skill processes.
